## Discussion Questions

1. Assume that an array [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5] is passed in to your insertion sort. What is the big O of your implementation of insertion sort when sorting this array? If n is the total number of elements in the array, how many operations does it take to sort each number, in terms of n?

2. Assume that an array [5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0] is passed in to your insertion sort. What is the big O of your implementation of insertion sort when sorting this array? If n is the total number of elements, how many operations does it take to sort each number, in terms of n? 

3. Compare your implementations of bubble sort, selection sort, and insertion sort on the arrays [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and [5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]. What are the big Os of your implementation of bubble and selection sorts when sorting these arrays? If n is the total number of elements in the array, how many operations does it take to sort each number, in terms of n, for both of these sorts?

4. Which of these three quadratic sorts do you think is the best? Why do you think so, and under what conditions is it the best? Are there any conditions where the other sorts are better? List one reason or one siutation when you might use each sort.

## Important notes

For this assignment (and every assignment/lab), you must login into the servers through `your_khoury_name@login.khoury.northeastern.edu` to complete and test your work. 

* Your code **must compile and run** on the Khoury machines to earn credit. Make sure you test your programs on these machines, as this is where we grade your assignments.
* You must commit any additional files(if any) into your repository so we can test your code.
  * Points will be lost if you forget!
* Do not forget, once you have pushed your changes to your repo make sure that you **submit them to Gradescope before the assignment deadline!**
